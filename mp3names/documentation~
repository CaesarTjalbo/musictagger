1. == GENERAL ==
The purpose of this program is to change filenames and id3 tags from mp3s and flacs.

2. == WORKFLOW ==
After start up, the user is supposed to navigate to a directory with music files. The user can then inspect the data collected from this directory, be it from tags or from file and directory names or alternatively, the user can provide her own data. After selecting the most suitable source of data, the user proceeds to a final screen where the data is presented in editable form. It's possible to apply certain rules to the data or set attributes wholesale. If the end result is satisfactorally, the user can chose to save the results to filenames and tags.
